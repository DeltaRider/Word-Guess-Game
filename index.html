                    <h2>The hip-hop/rap themed hangman game.</h2>
                    <p>Here's how to play:</p>
                    <p>You will be given a hint about a hip-hop/rap song, artist, or fact.  Keep in mind these ain't your momma's rap songs, artists, or facts.  This game only includes the realest.</p>
                    <p>With the hint, you will try to guess each letter in the word.  Each underscore represents one letter, as seen below.</p>
                    <p>If you guess the letter correclty, the underscore will be filled in with that letter.</p> 
                    <p>If you guess incorrectly, the man will begin the process of hanging.  You have 9 tries before he is fully hung.  A fully hung sucka means means you lose, sucka.</p> 
                    <p>If you guess every letter in the word before he is hung then I guess it's your lucky day...</p>
                    <p>Press the spacebar to begin!</p>
